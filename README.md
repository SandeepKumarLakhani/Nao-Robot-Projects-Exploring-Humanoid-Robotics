Welcome to my repository showcasing projects involving the Nao robot! This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments exploring the capabilities of the Nao robot in various contexts.

## About the Nao Robot

The Nao robot is a humanoid robot developed by SoftBank Robotics. It is known for its expressive movements, interactive capabilities, and versatile programming options, making it an ideal platform for learning and research in robotics.

## Projects Included
